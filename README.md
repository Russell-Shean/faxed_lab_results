A demonstration of how to extract data from faxed lab results

# Privacy note
All the data is fake! I found a bunch of fake examples online by googling "lab result faxes". No actual patient data is stored in the raw data folder. See the <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/faxes_text_extraction_demo/blob/main/fax_image_sources.R">`fax_image_sources.R`</a> file for links to where each fake data file came from.
